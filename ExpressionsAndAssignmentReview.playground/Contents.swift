/* Overview
 
 Your assignment is to create your own programming problem using variables, operators, and assignment. Think about the Operators playground you completed. This assignment is like you are producing a page for that assignment. You will work on your playground page in a playground cloned from GitHub. It should include *at least* the following:
 
 - three arithmetic operators
 - one compound operator
 - three variables
 - one type conversion
 
 It's not very exciting to have a bunch of random numbers in code. When writing this problem you should be creating a story around it. This need not be tremendously complex, just a simple story that motivates the values being used and gives them a context.
 
 For example 40 / 5 isn't interesting, but writing a tree planting app that given a species of tree and how much space you have will estimate how many trees you can plant is moreso. (e.g., I have 40 sq ft and want to plant walnut trees. They need 5 sq ft of growing space around the trunk, how many can I fit?).
 
 You should write your story bits in comments (e.g., between /* and */, or lines starting with // ) around where the code should go.

// create an app that adds up how many apples you have collected. create a variable called greenApples and give it a value beetween 0 - 100 then create a variable that is called redApples and give it a different value. Then create a variable called totalApples and add the red and green apples together. Then print the results. 

// now change the variable totalApples to applesFoundOutside and then creat a variable called applesFoundInside and subtract the two. 

//now create an app that will change fractions into decimals and create a variable that is called numerator and a variable that is called denomenator, then create a variable that is called fractionToDecimal. now divide the numerator by the denomenator and set it equal to fractionToDecimal. make sure to specify that all of your variable be type double. print your results.
